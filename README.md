## Model

For easier visuailzation (And to ensure the above cuts really work :3) I created a small model out of cardboard. 

I used 2mm thick cardboard and used a scale of 1 to 10. With that the thickness of the cardboard almost matched.

The back of the DJ table with space for records, headphones and other things.

![model-front-2](/images/model-front-2.jpg)

The front of the DJ table with small spaces for decoration, i.e. singles, plants, lava lamp, etc.

NOTE: As of now, the model does not have the cuts for the holes in the very top to put the CDJs and mixer in. They will come soon.


## Cut list

After creating the model, I prepared optimized cut list based on the table of the list of wood cuts above. I used a software I found online to draw the images. I came up with 2 different versions:

## Wood glazing

Because the spruce wood I got is very light in color, I got teak wood color glaze to protect the wood and achieve a more desired coloring.
